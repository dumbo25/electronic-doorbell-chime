# electronic-doorbell-chime

Create an electronic doorbell using existing Mechnical Chime and wiring to work with Arlo Doorbell or other smart doorbell supported by IFTTT

I could not get the Arlo Doorbell to make a mechanical chime work. I finally gave up and thought I would build my own electronic doorbell chime
